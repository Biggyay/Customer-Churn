Customer Churn Prediction
Introduction
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, especially in highly competitive industries. Understanding and predicting customer churn can help organizations to proactively address potential customer losses and improve retention strategies. This repository provides tools, methodologies, and models for analyzing and predicting customer churn using various machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
In this project, we focus on leveraging historical customer data to develop predictive models that can forecast the likelihood of customer churn. The goal is to build a robust and accurate model that can help businesses identify at-risk customers and take appropriate actions to retain them.

Key Features
Data Exploration: Scripts and notebooks for exploring and visualizing customer data.
Feature Engineering: Techniques for creating meaningful features from raw data.
Model Development: Implementation of various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
Model Evaluation: Metrics and tools for evaluating model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Methods for optimizing model parameters to improve performance.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README file. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for each stage of the analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
